## Narrative

As a licensed pilot with over 300 flight hours, I need to obtain a usage agreement for Monterey Bay Academy Airport to conduct my flight training activities. I visit the CA-66 Agreement Generator website and complete the straightforward four-section form, entering my personal information, aircraft details, and insurance coverage. The system immediately validates that my insurance meets the $1,000,000 minimum requirement and confirms my flight hours exceed the safety threshold. After reviewing the automatically calculated agreement terms, including the $250 annual fee and one-year agreement period, I click "Generate Agreement" and receive a professionally formatted, print-ready PDF document that I can immediately use for insurance submissions and airport management approval, confident that the document meets all legal and formatting standards required for official use.
